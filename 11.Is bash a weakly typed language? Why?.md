Is bash a weakly typed language? Why?

Yes, bash is considered a weakly or loosely typed language because it does not require to declare the type of the data at the time of variable declaration. All bash variables are treated as a string by default and the type of the variable will be set based on the current value. Bash variables with data types can be defined by using declare command with a particular option. But the options to define data types are limited and don’t support all types of data. For example, float data type can’t be declared by using declare command.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#The data type of $myVar is string by default
myVar=29

# Print the variable
echo $myVar

# Declare integer variable $number with the value 67
declare -i number=67

#Print the variable
echo $number

# Assign string data into the numeric variable. The following line will generate
# syntax error and the value of $number will not change
number="I like bash"
echo $number
```
