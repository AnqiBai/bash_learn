How to cut and print some part of a string data in bash?

Bash has no built-in function like other languages to cut some portion of the string data. But using parameter expansion any string value can be cut in bash. Three parts can be defined in parameter expansion by separating with a colon to cut any part of the string data. Here, the first two parts are mandatory and the last part is optional. The first part contains the main string variable that will be used to cut, the second part is the starting position from where the string will be cut and the third part is the length of the cutting string. The starting position must be counted from 0 and the length must be counted from 1 of the main string to retrieve the cutting value.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Initialize a string value into $string
string="Python Scripting Language"
# Cut the string value from the position 7 to the end of the string
echo ${string:7}
# Cut the string value of 9 characters from the position 7
echo ${string:7:9}
# Cut the string value from 17 to 20
echo ${string:17:-4}
```
