How to read the second word or column from each line of a file?

The second word or column of a file can be read in a bash script by using different bash commands easily, such as `awk`, `sed` etc. Here, the use of `awk` is shown in the following example.  
Example: Suppose, course.txt file contains the following content and we have printed only the second word of each line of this file.

# The following script will print the second word of each line from course.txt file.
# the output of cat command will pass to awk command that will read the second word
# of each line.
echo `cat course.txt | awk '{print $2}'`
```
