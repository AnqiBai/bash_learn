How to find out the length of a string data?

‘expr’, ‘wc’ and ‘awk’ commands can be used to find out the length of a string data in bash. ‘expr’ and ‘awk’ commands use length option, ‘wc’ command uses ‘–c’ option to count the length of the string.

Example:

The uses of the above commands are shown in the following script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Count length using `expr` length option
echo `expr length "I like PHP"`
# Count length using `wc` command
echo "I like Bash" | wc -c
# Count length using `awk` command
echo "I like Python" | awk '{print length}'
```
