How can you print a particular line of a file in bash?

There are many ways to print a particular line in bash. How the ‘awk’, ‘sed’ and ‘tail’ commands can be used to print a particular line of a file in bash is shown in the following example.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read and store the first line from the file by using `awk` command with NR variable
line1=`awk '{if(NR==1) print $0}' course.txt`
# Print the line
echo $line1

# Read the second line from the file by using `sed` command with -n option
line2=`sed -n 2p course.txt`
# Print the line
echo $line2

# Read the last line from the file by using `tail` command with -n option
line3=`tail -n 1 course.txt`
# Print the file
echo $line3
```
