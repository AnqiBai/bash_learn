How can a bash script be terminated without executing all statements?

Using ‘exit’ command, a bash script can be terminated without executing all statements. The following script will check if a particular file exists or not. If the file exists, then it will print the total characters of the file and if the file does not exist then it will terminate the script by showing a message.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize the filename to the variable, $filename
filename="course.txt"

# Check the file exists or not by using -f option
if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
    # Print message if the file exists
    echo "$filename exists"
else
    # Print message if the file doesn't exist
    echo "$filename not exists"
    # Terminate the script
    exit 1
fi

# Count the length of the file if the file exists
length=`wc -c $filename`

# Print the length of the file
echo "Total characters - $length"
```
