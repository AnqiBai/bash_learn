What types of variables are used in bash?

Two types of variables can be used in bash script. These are:

System variables
The variables which are pre-defined and maintained by the Linux operating system are called system variables. These type of variables are always used by an uppercase letter. The default values of these variables can be changed based on requirements.

`set`, `env` and `printenv` commands can be used to print the list of system variables.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Printing System Variables

#Print Bash shell name
echo $BASH

# Print Bash shell Version
echo $BASH_VERSION

# Print Home directory name
echo $HOME
```

User-defined variable

The variables which are created and maintained by users are called user-defined variables. They are also called local variables. These types of variables can be declared by using lowercase or uppercase or both uppercase and lowercase letters. But it is better to avoid using all uppercase letter to differentiate the variables from system variables.
Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

num=100
echo $num
```
