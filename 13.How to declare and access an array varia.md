How to declare and access an array variable in bash?

Both numeric and associative arrays are supported by a bash script. An array variable can be declared with and without declare command. –a option is used with declare command to define a numeric array and –A option is used with declare statement to define an associative array in bash. Without declare command, the numeric array can be defined only in bash.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Declare a simple numeric array
arr1=( CodeIgniter Laravel ReactJS )

# Print the first element value of $arr1
echo ${arr1[0]}

# Declare a numeric array using declare command
declare -a arr2=( HTML CSS JavaScript )

# Print the second element value of $arr2
echo ${arr2[1]}

# Declare an associative array using declare statement
declare -A arr3=( [framework]=Laravel [CMS]=Wordpress [Library]=JQuery )

# Print the third element value of $arr3
echo ${arr3[Library]}
```

All elements of an array can be accessed by using any loop or ‘\*’ symbol as an array index.
