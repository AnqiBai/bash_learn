‘case’ statement can be used as an alternative tp if-elseif-if statement. The syntax for ‘case’ statement in bash scripts is different from the switch-case statement of other programming languages. ‘case’ block is closed by ‘esac’ statement in bash. No ‘break‘ statement is used inside ‘case‘ block to terminate from the block.

Syntax:

case in
Match pattern 1) commands;;
Match pattern 2) commands;;
……
Match pattern n) commands;;
esac
Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#Initialize the variable $ticket
ticket=101

# Compare the value of $ticket with 23, 101 and 503

case $ticket in 23)

# Print message if the value is 23

echo "You got the first prize";; 101)

# Print message if the value is 101

echo "You got the second prize";; 503)

# Print message if the value is 503

echo "You got the third prize";;
\*)

# Print message if the value does not match with 23, 101 and 503

echo "Sorry, try for the next time"
exit 0;;
esac
```
