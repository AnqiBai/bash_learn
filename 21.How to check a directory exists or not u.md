How to check a directory exists or not using bash?

Bash has many test commands to check if a file or directory exists or not and the type of the file. ‘-d’ option is used with a directory path as a conditional statement to check if the directory exists or not in bash. If the directory exists, then it will return true otherwise it will return false.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash                                                                  
# Assign the directory with path in the variable, $path
path="/home/ubuntu/temp"
# Check the directory exists or not
if [ -d "$path" ]; then
   # Print message if the directory exists
   echo "Directory exists"
else
   # Print message if the directory doesn’t exist
   echo "Directory not exists"
fi
```
