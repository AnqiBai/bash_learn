Mention some ways to perform arithmetic operations in bash?

Arithmetic operations can be done in multiple ways in bash. ‘let’, ‘expr’, ‘bc’ and double brackets are the most common ways to perform arithmetic operations in bash. The uses of these commands are shown in the following example.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Calculating the subtraction by using expr and parameter expansion
var1=$( expr 120 - 100 )
# print the result
echo $var1
# Calculate the addition by using let command
let var2=200+300
# Print the rsult
echo $var2
# Calculate and print the value of division using ‘bc’ to get the result
# with fractional value
echo "scale=2; 44/7" | bc
# Calculate the value of multiplication using double brackets
var3=$(( 5*3 ))
# Print the result
echo $var3
```
