How to declare and delete variables in bash?

The variable can be declared in bash by data type or without data type. If any bash variable is declared without declare command, then the variable will be treated as a string. Bash variable is declared with declare command to define the data type of the variable at the time declaration.

–r, -i, -a, -A, -l, -u, -t and –x options can be used with declare command to declare a variable with different data types.

Example:

#!/bin/bash

#Declare variable without any type
num=10

#Values will be combined but not added
result=$num+20
echo $result

#Declare variable with integer type
declare -i num=10

#Values will be added
declare -i result=num+20
echo $result
unset command is used to remove any bash variable. The variable will be inaccessible or undefined after using unset command.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

str="Linux Hint"
echo $str
unset $str
echo $str
```
