How to make a bash file executable?

Executable bash files can be made by using ‘chmod’ command. Executable permission can be set by using ‘+x’ in chmod command with the script filename. Bash files can be executed without the explicit ‘bash’ command after setting the execution bit for that file.

Example:

```bash
# Set the execution bit
$ chmod +x filename.sh

# Run the executable file
$ ./filename.sh
```
