What is IFS?

IFS is a special shell variable. The full form of IFS is Internal Field Separator,
it acts as delimiter to separate the word from the line of text. It is mainly used for splitting a string, reading a command, replacing text etc.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Declare ':' as delimiter for splitting the text
IFS=":"
# Assign text data with ':' to $text
text="Red:Green:Blue"
# for loop will read each word after splitting the text based on IFS
for val in $text; do
    # Print the word
    echo $val
done
```
