What different types of loops can be used in bash?

Three types of loops are supported by a bash script. These are while, for and until loops. Loops in bash check the condition at the start of the loop. While loop works until the condition remains true and until loop works until the condition remains false. There are two ways to use for loop. One is general for loop that contains three parts and another is for-in loop. The uses of these three loops are shown in the following example.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Initialize $n
n=5
# Calculate the square of 5-1 using while loop
while [ $n -gt 0 ]
do
   sqr=$((n*n))
   echo "The square of $n is $sqr"
   ((n--))
done

# Calculate the square of 5-1 using for loop
for (( i=5; i>0; i-- ))
do
   sqr=$((i*i))
   echo "The square of $i is $sqr"
done

# Initialize $x
x=5

# Calculate the square of 5-1 using until loop
until [ $x -le 0 ]
do
   sqr=$((x*x))
   echo "The square of $x is $sqr"
   ((x--))
done
```
