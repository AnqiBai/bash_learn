How can conditional statements be used in bash?

The most common conditional statement in most programming languages is the if-elseif-else statement. The syntax of if-elseif-else statement in bash is a little bit different from other programming languages. ‘If’ statement can be declared in two ways in a bash script and every type of ‘if’ block must be closed with ‘fi’. ‘if’ statement can be defined by third brackets or first brackets like other programming languages.

Syntax:
A.

```bash
if [ condition ];
then
statements
fi
```

B.

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
statements 1
else
statement 2
fi
```

C.

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
statement 1
elif [ condition ]; then
statement 2
….
else
statement n
fi
```

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Assign a value to $n
n=30
# Check $n is greater than 100 or not
if [ $n -gt 100 ]; then
    echo "$n is less than 100"
# Check $n id greater than 50 or not
elif [ $n -gt 50 ]; then
    echo "$n is less than 50"
else
    echo "$n is less than 50"
fi
```
