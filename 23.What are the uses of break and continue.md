What are the uses of break and continue statements in bash?

break statement is used to terminate from a loop without completing the full iteration based on a condition and continue statement is used in a loop to omit some statements based on a condition. The uses of break and continue statements are explained in the following example.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Initialize the variable $i to 0 to start the loop
i=0
# the loop will iterate fot 10 times
while [ $i -le 10 ]
do
    # Increment the value $i by 1
    (( i++ ))
    # If the value of $i equal to 8 then terminate the loop by using 'break' statement
    if [ $i -eq 8 ]; then
         break;
    fi
    # If the value of $i is greater than 6 then omit the last statement of the loop
    #  by using continue statement
    if [ $i -ge 6 ]; then
         continue;
    fi
    echo "the current value of i = $i"
done

# Print the value of $i after terminating from the loop
echo "Now the value of i = $i"
```
