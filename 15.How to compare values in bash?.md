How to compare values in bash?

Six types of comparison operators can be used in bash to compare values. There are two ways to use these operators in bash depending on the data type. These are mentioned below.

String Comparison Integer Comarison Description
== -eq It is used to check equality
!= -ne It is used to check inequality
< -lt It is used check the first value is less than the second value or not

>     -gt	It is used check the first value is greater than the second value or not
>
> <= -le It is used check the first value is less than or equal to the second value or not
> = -ge It is used check the first value is greater than or equal to the second value or not

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Initialize $n
n=130
o="even"
# Check $n is greater than or equal to 100 or not using ‘–ge’.
if [ $n -ge 100 ]; then
     echo "$n is greater than or equal to 100"
else
     echo "$n is less than 100"
fi
# Check $n is even or odd using ‘==’ operator
if (( $o == "even" )); then
     echo "The number is even"
else
     echo "The number is odd"
fi
```
