How to use command-line arguments in bash?

Command-line arguments are read by $1, $2, $3â€¦$n variables. Command-line argument values are provided in the terminal when executing the bash script. $1 is used to read the first argument, $2 is used to read the second argument and so on.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#Check any argument is provided or not
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "No argument is given."
    exit 0
fi
#Store the first argument value
color=$1
# Print the argument with other string
printf "You favorite color is %s\n" $color
```
