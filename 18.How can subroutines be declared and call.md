How can subroutines be declared and called in bash?

In bash a function or procedure is called a subroutine. The declaration and calling of a subroutine in bash is different from other languages. No argument can be declared in subroutines unlike other standard programming languages. But local variables can be defined within the subroutine by using the ‘local’ keyword.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Initialize the variable $x and $y which are global
x=10
y=35

# Declare the function
myFunc () {
   # Declare the local variable $x
   local x=15

   # Re-assign the global variable $y
   y=25

   # Calculate the sum of $x and $y
   z=$((x+y))

   # Print the sum of a local variable, $x, and global variable, $y
   echo "The sum of $x and $y equal to $z"
}

# Call the function
myFunc

# Print the sum of global variables, $x, and $y
echo "The sum of $x and $y equal to $z"
```
